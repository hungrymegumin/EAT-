###How to use this test framework
---

This test framwork is based on Python3, so make sure Python3 intepreter is installed in your computer correctly.

First of all,you should enter the folder
```
cd Test
```
In this folder , there are many sub-folders in it,each sub-folders contains a test-case.
There is a file named 'testList.txt' in your workspace . By default It is empty which means it will check all the test-cases,but,If you need, you can also choise test-cases manually, just add case's name in the file,like this:
```
add 0001
div 0001
```
Secondly,just run the test.py like this:
```
python3 test.py
```
Be careful,you shoud run this python file in current workspace(Test).

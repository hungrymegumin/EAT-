# A Brief Introduction of Deepvm

Deepvm is the a virtual machine, as the backend of DeepLang, a new language for IoT device.

Our goal is to make the WebAssembly IR run on the virtual machine.

At present, our project is still in the initial stage of development. We support a limited set of introductions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, etc.

In the future, we will support more instructions according to the needs of the Deeplang.
